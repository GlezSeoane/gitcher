# Next tasks TO DO on this project

## User experience

1. Command line via. Most important functions must be accessed without user interaction. This will make gitcher scriptable.
2. Profile update option.
3. Profile create from duplicate option.


## Model layer

4. ~~Check user inputs. For example, although it is unlikely that it does, if the user enters a comma, the program will fail to read later the CHERFILE because that is the sign of separation~~.
5. ~~It would be interesting can add comments to the CHERFILE. To allow the file to be edited with greater security, a file integrity checking function could be proposed~~.


## Distribution

6. PYPI register.
