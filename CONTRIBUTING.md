## Style guides and conventions

### Code style guide

Gitcher is written in Python, so the PEP-8 rules will be followed to the code standardization. It is highly recommended to use an IDE that revise PEP-8 conventions in your code, as, for example JetBrains's PyCharm.

**Pull request or other type of contributions that not respect PEP-8's conventions could be discarded. The code standardization is a very important part of a good managed software project.**

You can take a look of PEP-8 in the article *[PEP-8: Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)*.

If you don't want to read PEP-8, please observe yet implement code and try to emulate the presentation.


### Git commit messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Use the first line as subject line.
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable tag attending its normal form:
	- `docs:`: documentation.
	- `feat:`: new features.
	- `fix`: fixes of present features.
	- `style`: code cleanliness.
- Limit the first line to 50 characters or less. Start with capital letter and do not close with a dot.
- Add a white line after the subject line.
- Limit all the lines but first to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.


### Git branching

This repository follows the [Vincent Driessen's successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

The `master` branch is reserved to merges of releases and some documentation changes. The releases are identified with a tag.

Other things will be done in `develop` branch, which can contain other feat-specific branches, if necessary. The release-itself stuff will be done in an `rel-<release-index>` specific branch, then merged in `master` and `develop`.

It is recommended to use `git-workflow` to facilitate the processes. This tools was developed by Vincent Driessen, the author of our Git branching model, so they fit perfectly.
